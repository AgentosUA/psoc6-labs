/**
* \mainpage Cypress Device Firmware Update (DFU) SDK
*
* \section section_mainpage_overview Overview
*
* The purpose of the DFU SDK is to provide a low-level SDK for
* updating firmware images. 
*
* Include cy_dfu.h to get access to all functions and other declarations in this library.
*
* The DFU SDK has the following features:
* - Reading firmware images from the updating host through a number of
*   transport interfaces, e.g. BLE, USB, UART, I2C, SPI, I2C.
* - Programming a firmware image to the specified address in internal Flash, 
*   SMIF, or any external memory that supports the DFU SDK API.
* - Copying applications.
* - Validating applications.
* - Safe Updating: updating images at temporary location, validating
*   them and if valid, overwrite working images.
* - Switching firmware applications.
*   Passing parameters in RAM when switching firmware applications.
* - Supports encrypted update image files. \n
*   Transfers encrypted images to firmware without decrypting in the middle.
* - Supports up to 28 firmware images. Each of them can be a updater.
* - Supports customization.
* - CRC-32 checksum to validate firmware data.
* - Designed to support Secure Library for PSoC6.
*
* \note Not all mentioned transport interfaces are supported out of the box
*
* The DFU SDK can be used for designing updating applications of
* arbitrary flexibility and complexity. Also simple for simple cases.
*
* The simplest DFU SDK application is provided at the
* CE213903 - Basic DFU code example.
*
* \section group_dfu_config Configuration Considerations
*
* \subsection group_dfu_config_linker_scripts Linker scripts
*
* The DFU SDK projects use linker scripts a bit different from the
* default startup linker scripts.
*
* Changes compared to startup linker scripts:
*
* 1. dfu_cm0p.{ld, icf, scat}, dfu_cm4.{ld, icf, scat}
*    These files are the templates of linker script files for building
*    DFU SDK applications.
*    These files are DFU SDK specific, the startup linker scripts define
*    the memory layout by themselves. 
*
* 2. dfu_common.h and dfu_mdk_symbols.c for MDK.
*
*    These files define symbols for the memory layout for each application 
*    inside the device for the MDK compiler.
* 
* \par Common part of CM4/CM0+ linker scripts (dfu_{cm0p, cm4}.ld)
* This part of GCC linker script files used for each application, and must 
* have the same memory layout across all the application projects inside the 
* designed device.
*
* Any changes made to it in any application must be copied to other
* applications <i>dfu_{cm0p, cm4}.ld</i> files.
*
* Memory regions:
* * <i>flash_app{X}_core{Y}</i> - The memory region for Flash code and data
*   of the user application {X} MCU core {Y}.
* * <i>flash_storage</i> - The optional memory region to place shared or 
*   application specific code or data outside of the application.
* * <i>flash_boot_meta</i> - The optional memory region for the DFU SDK
*   metadata. Cypress DFU SDK code examples place DFU SDK metadata
*   inside this region. The user is free to place it in any other way.
* * <i>sflash_user_data</i>, <i>efuse</i>, <i>flash_toc</i>, <i>em_eeprom</i>,
*   <i>xip</i> - These are the regions not used by typical DFU
*   SDK code examples. They are kept because they may be used in user
*   code.
* * <i>ram_common</i> - The memory region for data that to be shared between
*   DFU SDK applications.
*   The user may place it anywhere inside the RAM, but all the applications must
*   have the same location of it.
*   So, one app sets some values there, switches to another app.
*   Then that another app may read or update the values.
* * <i>ram_app{X}_core{Y}</i> - The memory region for RAM data, stack, heap etc. 
*   for the user app{X} MCU core {Y}.
* 
* ELF file symbols:
* CyMCUElfTool uses special ELF file symbols besides command-line arguments for
* its configuration.
* 1. __cy_memory_{N}_start - Defines the start address of the memory region.
*    __cy_memory_{N}_length - Defines the length of the memory region.
*    __cy_memory_{N}_row_size - Defines the row size of the memory region.
*
*    CyMCUElfTool uses these symbols to determine which memory regions should be
*    placed into the HEX and CYACD2 files. I.e. without these symbols, some data
*    like XIP may be absent in the HEX file.
*
*    These symbols are critical for CYACD2 file generation, CyMCUElfTool
*    must know the row size of all the data being exported to the CYACD2
*    file. The updating is done by rows, and a row size may vary across
*    the memory regions.
*
*    E.g. Internal Flash of PSoC6 devices start at address 0x1000_0000 and
*    the length and row size may de device-dependent, but let's assume it is
*    512KB and 512 bytes. The memory symbols for the internal Flash will be:
*    <code>
*        __cy_memory_0_start    = 0x10000000;
*        __cy_memory_0_length   = 512 * 1024;
*        __cy_memory_0_row_size = 512;
*    </code>
*
*    The number _{N}_ in the memory symbol indicates that there may be multiple
*    memories.
* 2. __cy_boot_metadata_addr and __cy_boot_metadata_length.
*    These symbols are used by the DFU SDK internally to access the
*    metadata as the  metadata location is user-configurable.
* 3. __cy_product_id - used by CyMCUElfTool to be placed in the CYACD2 header.
*    This value is used by the updating Host and DFU SDK firmware to
*    confirm that the CYACD2 file being updated is compatible with
*    the device.
*
*    E.g. The user may have two different devices with the same PSoC6 chip:
*    * A coffee machine, with Product ID - 0x1000_0001.
*    * A nuclear power plant control device with Product ID - 0x1000_0002.
*    The user of a coffee machine tries to update firmware for a nuclear
*    power plant control device, and the DFU Host will indicate that
*    the device rejected this firmware because of the wrong Product ID.
* 4. __cy_app{N}_base, __cy_app{N}_size.
*    These symbols are used by the dfu_user.c file to initialize the
*    metadata. Their value is automatically updated by the linker when the
*    user updates the memory layout (memory regions).
*
*    If the user decided to use a different mechanism for SDK metadata
*    initialization, then these symbols can be removed.
* 5. __cy_boot_signature_size.
*    Used by the DFU SDK linker scripts only. It helps avoiding the magic
*    number for a signature size to be scattered throughout all the linker 
*    scripts.
*    E.g.
*    * For the CRC-32C application signature, the value of this symbol is 4 
*      (bytes).
*    * For RSASSA-PCKS-1-v1.5 with RSA 2048, the value is 256 (bytes).
* 6. __cy_checksum_type.
*    The checksum type for the DFU transport packet verification used by 
*    CyMCUElfTool to generate a updating file. Must be aligned with 
*    \ref CY_DFU_OPT_PACKET_CRC
*
* \par File dfu_cm0p.ld
* This file is a linker script for the CM0+ core for DFU SDK
* applications.
*
* It is similar to the default startup GCC's CM0+ linker script but with some
* differences:
* 1. __cy_app_id.
*    This ELF file symbols are used by CyMCUElfTool to set an application ID in 
*    the CYACD2 file header.
* 2. __cy_app_core1_start_addr.
*    This ELF file symbol is used for the CM0+ C code in the main_cm0p.c file 
*    to know the start address of the CM4 code.
*    Its value gets automatically updated when the memory layout gets changed.
*    The user should update the application number, when this linker script
*    is used for applications other than app 0.
* 3. __cy_app_verify_start, __cy_app_verify_length.
*    These two symbols are used by CyMCUElfTool to generate an application
*    signature. The first symbol provides a value of the start of signed memory 
*    and the second - the length of signed memory.
* 4. Section ".cy_boot_noinit".
*    Used to place data to be shared between the
*    applications. See the description of the ram_common memory region.
* 5. Section ".cy_boot_metadata".
*    Contains the DFU SDK metadata. This section name is necessary only
*    for CyMCUElfTool to sign the section with the CRC-32C checksum 
*    of this section data.
*    If no CRC-32C at the end of the metadata is required, then the section can
*    be renamed.
*
* \par File dfu_cm4.ld
* This file is a linker script for CM4 core for the DFU SDK
* applications.
*
* It is similar to a default startup GCC's CM0+ linker script and to a CM0+
* DFU SDK linker script but with some differences:
*
* Section .cy_app_signature.
* This section is used to place an application signature.
* The signature is used by the DFU SDK to verify that the application is
* valid.
*
* Typically, CRC, SHA or any other hash of the application code and data is
* placed here.
* CyMCUElfTool updates this section in the post-build step.
*
* The memory for which the signature is calculated is defined by the
* following ELF file symbols:
*    __cy_app_verify_start, __cy_app_verify_length.
*
* \par Files dfu_{cm0p, cm4}.{icf, scat}
* These files are the linker scripts for the CM0+ and CM4 cores for IAR and MDK
* compilers for the DFU SDK applications.
*
* Their difference from the default startup linker scripts are similar to
* the DFU SDK GCC's linker scripts described above.
